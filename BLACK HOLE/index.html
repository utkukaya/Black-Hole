     <li>A black hole is a place in space
     where gravity pulls so much that even light can not get out.
     A black hole does not have a surface, like a planet or star. 
     Matter has squeezed into a tiny space. Therefore, the gravity 
     is so strong. This can occur when star is dying.</li>
 
     <li>Albert Einstein first predicted black holes 1916 with his 
     general theory of relativity. The term "black hole " was coined 
     in 1967 by American astronomer Jhon Wheeler, and the first one was 
     discovered in 1971.</li>
  
     <li>Black hole can not be noticed because no light can get out.
     They are invisible. Space telescopes with special tools can help
     to find black hole. Stars that are very close to black holes act
     diffirently than other stars can be seen with the special tools.

    <i>
    <li>Black hole could be big or small. It is thought to the fact 
    that the smallest black holes are as small as just one atom 
    by scientists. Although these black holes are very tiny, 
    they have the mass of a large mountain.Mass is the amount 
    of matter, or "stuff," in an object.</li>

    <li>Stellar is another kind of black hole.Stellar black holes are 
    small but they are quite deadly. Its mass can be more than 20 times 
    mass of sun. This leads to a crazy amount of gravitational force
    pulling on objects around it. Black holes consume the dust and gas 
    from the galaxy around them, growing in size. There may be many,
    many stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy.Earth galaxy is 
    called the Milky Way.</li>

    <li>Supermassive black holes are the largest black holes.
    Moreover they have a radius similar to that of Earth's closest star.
    Masses of these black holes are more than 1 million suns together.
    Proof that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black holes 
    at its center have been found by scientists. The supermassive 
    black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is called 
    Sagittarius A. It has a mass equal to about 4 million suns and 
    would fit inside a very large ball that could hold
    a few million Earths.</li>

    <li>It is believed to the fact that the smallest black holes formed

    <li>When the center of a very big star falls in upon itself, 
    or collapses; Stellar black holes are made. When this happens 
    it causes a supernova. A supernova is an exploding star that blasts 
    part of the star into space.It is thought to the fact that 
    supermassive black holes were made at the same time 
    as the galaxy they are in.</li,>
